# Iago Lourenço Corrêa

I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Automation at the Federal University of Rio Grande - FURG in 2021. During my graduation, I researched the automatic classification of microalgae through machine learning, especially with deep learning. My graduation project concerned the adoption of combination methods to improve OCR accuracy.
